# journy.io Python SDK

This is the official Python SDK for [journy.io](https://journy.io?utm_source=github&utm_content=readme-python-sdk).

## üíæ Installation

You can use the python package manager (`pip`) to install the SDK:

```bash
pip install journyio-python-sdk
```

## üîå Getting started

### Import

To start, first import the client.

```pyhton

```

### Configuration

To be able to use the journy.io SDK you need to generate an API key. If you don't have one you can create one in [journy.io](https://system.journy.io?utm_source=github&utm_content=readme-python-sdk).

If you don't have an account yet, you can create one in [journy.io](https://system.journy.io/register?utm_source=github&utm_content=readme-python-sdk) or [request a demo first](https://www.journy.io/book-demo?utm_source=github&utm_content=readme-python-sdk).

Go to your settings, under the *Connections*-tab, to create and edit API keys. Make sure to give the correct permissions to the API Key.

```python

```

### Methods

#### Link web visitor to an app user

You can link a web visitor to a user in your application when you have our snippet installed on your website. The snippet sets a cookie named `__journey`. If the cookie exists, you can link the web visitor to the user that is currently logged in:

```python

```

#### Add event

```python

```

#### Get tracking snippet for a domain

```python

```

### Handling errors

Every call will return a result, we don't throw errors when a call fails. We don't want to break your application when things go wrong. An exception will be thrown for required arguments that are empty or missing.


```python

```

The request ID can be useful when viewing API logs in [journy.io](https://system.journy.io?utm_source=github&utm_content=readme-python-sdk).
